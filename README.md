This project serves as a practical exploration of adding functionality to existing code and using separation of concerns principles. Implemented in JavaScript, it's designed for educational purposes to illustrate these concepts in a clear and concise manner. While not a groundbreaking application, it provides valuable hands-on experience for those learning JavaScript fundamentals.
